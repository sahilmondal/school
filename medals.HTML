        <u> <h3>Due to COVID-19 protocols, the medals were presented to the athletes on a tray and each athlete was asked to put on their own medal, rather than have it placed around their neck by a dignitary.</h3></u>

        <p><b>n February 2017, the Tokyo Organizing Committee announced an electronics recycling program in partnership with Japan Environmental Sanitation Center and NTT Docomo, soliciting donations of electronics such as mobile phones to be reclaimed as materials for the medals. Aiming to collect eight tonnes of metals to produce the medals for the Olympic and Paralympic Games, collection boxes were deployed at public locations and NTT Docomo retail shops in April 2017.[108][109] A design competition for the medals was launched in December of that year.[110]

            In May 2018, the organizing committee reported that they had obtained half the required 2,700 kilograms of bronze but were struggling to obtain the required amount of silver; although bronze and silver medals purely utilize their respective materials, IOC requirements mandate that gold medals utilize silver as a base.[111] The collection of bronze was completed in November 2018, with the remainder estimated to have been completed by March 2019.[112]
            
            On 24 July 2019 (one year ahead of the originally scheduled opening ceremony), the designs of the medals were unveiled.[113][114] The medals for the Olympic and Paralympic Games were designed by Junichi Kawanishi following a nationwide competition.[115] A new feature shared with the Paralympic medals is that the ribbons contain one, two, or three silicone convex lines to distinguish gold, silver, and bronze medals, respectively.[</b></p>
