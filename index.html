            Tokyo was selected as the host city during the 125th IOC Session in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on 7 September 2013.[2] Originally scheduled to take place from 24 July to 9 August 2020, the event was postponed to 2021 in March 2020 as a result of the COVID-19
            pandemic, the first such instance in the history of the Olympic Games (previous games had been cancelled but not rescheduled).[3] However, the event retained the Tokyo 2020 name for marketing and branding purposes.[4] It was largely held behind
            closed doors with no public spectators permitted due to the declaration of a state of emergency in the Greater Tokyo Area in response to the pandemic.[b] The Games were the most expensive ever, with total spending of over $20 billion. [6]
            The Summer Paralympics were held between 24 August and 5 September 2021, 16 days after the completion of the Olympics. <br>New events were introduced in existing sports for 2020, including 3x3 basketball, freestyle BMX and mixed
            gender team events in a number of existing sports, as well as the return of madison cycling for men and an introduction of the same event for women. New IOC policies also allowed the host organizing committee to add new sports to the Olympic
            program for just one Games. The disciplines added by the Japanese Olympic Committee were baseball and softball, karate, sport climbing, surfing and skateboarding, the last four of which made their Olympic debuts, and the last three of which
            will remain on the Olympic program.[9]
